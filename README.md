Unsupervised clustering techniques:
There is a database called “data.npy” that contains 3879 examples with 18 features each. Each example corresponds to an aircraft trajectory with its position in the sky and other significant features. The objective here is to study unsupervised clustering techniques that allow to group the examples in the data set.
